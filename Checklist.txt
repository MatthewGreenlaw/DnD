Things to do:

o Figure out what to do about rooms that only go one way 
	-(IE. Room1 does not go to Room5 but Room5 goes to Room1)
	-Secret passage?
	-Fix all together?
o Add xy coord to rooms
o Base room coord off door placement to last room
o Validate incoming rooms fin it availiable space 
	-if this.x is in the range of last.x through last.x+width... 
		-move x to fit (would also need to figure out if there is any other threatened space from another room)
		-add a z coord to signify x is on an upper or lower level and revalidate (would have to figure out stairs)
o Implement SFML representation
